Brainstem white matter bundles are essential conduits for neural signals that modulate human consciousness and homeostasis. Yet, their small size and complex architecture make segmentation challenging in neuroimaging studies. We leveraged diffusion MRI tractography to create the BrainStem Bundle Tool (BSBT), which automatically segments eight brainstem white matter bundles. BSBT performs unsupervised segmentation with a convolutional neural network on a custom probabilistic fiber map generated from tractography. Validation on healthy subject in vivo diffusion MRI, ex vivo diffusion MRI with histology, and test-retest analyses show BSBT's robustness across diffusion MRI acquisition protocols. We demonstrate the generalizability of BSBT through discrimination tasks in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury cohorts. Finally, we explore the prognostic utility of BSBT in a longitudinal analysis of a comatose patient with a midbrain lesion. BSBT creates opportunities to map brainstem white matter and investigate its role in a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.
